# Free-Food-App
The Free Food App is an iOS app that helps you find the location of Free Food around you. Anyone can submit a post when they come across free or cheap food. Other users can keep the posting up to date by either voting the post up (signifying they confirm that the food is there) or down (meaning the food is missing).

The app is still a work in progress. Stay tuned for updates.
